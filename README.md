Find the needle in the haystack!

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `https://localhost:3000`:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You need to trust the certificate. The webapp has to run on https so that the camera can be accessed.
